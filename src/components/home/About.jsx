      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!</p>
      <p>My name is Angelito, I do appreciate your time for checking my portfolio!</p>
      <p>Back then, I was overwhelmed by the vast opportunities that the IT industry could offer to the point that I didn't know what to pursue. As I went through each of them, one thing that caught my attention was web development. Although the complexity of programming has been intimidating for me as a beginner, the satisfaction of observing the whole project execute its functions is a rewarding experience. I thought I was only studying to enhance my technical skills and logical thinking. Still, programming taught me a greater sense of discipline, perseverance, and understanding, which in turn helped me improve my overall well-being.</p>
      <p>Cheers to more growth and learning, Ciao!</p>
